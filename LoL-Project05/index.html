        <h1>Prediction - Project5</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>This is a project for DSC80 where we clean and perform machine learnings to find predictions of specific data.</p>
        
        <p><b>Name(s):</b> Ruhua Pan </p>
        
        <h2>Introduction: </h2>
        
        <p>This time I choose to pick the topic: To Predict which role (top-lane, jungle, support, etc.) a player played given their post-game data. </p>
        
        <p><i>I'm out of any sense of creativity - I'll admit that. </i></p>
        
        <p>I decided to use data from the very first few leagues only and from the same patch. I've decided to train the model on the top 9 leagues, exclusively because matches might get very different in competitive and non-competitive leagues. Besides, we'll use complete games only. </p>

        <p>Let's do the data cleaning then: </p>

        <h3>Data Cleaning </h3>


        <hr> 
        <p> We first select the wanted rows use data in 'league', and then keep only'position', 'kills', 'deaths', 'assists', 'teamkills', 'teamdeaths', 'damageshare', 'visionscore', 'damagetakenperminute', 'damagemitigatedperminute', 'minionkills', 'firstblood', and 'earnedgoldshare'. 
            I decided to keep as many as possible data in a proportion fashion, because we are mostly focusing about differences inside a team, so that the win/lost result doesnt affect that much. Here I use kills/teamkills and deaths/teamdeaths as killshare and deathshare. 
            After that, we need to get rid of all team data because we focus on players.</p>
        <p>We will then one-hot code the position column and seperate it into 5 different columns with possibilities. That makes our analysis rather be "estimate the possibility a player playing 'top', and do that for all 5 positions.</p>

        <p><b>Descriptions of Columns:</b></p>
        <p>damageshare:  a float indicating how much damage a player has done out of the whole team.<br>
        visionscore:  A score used to calculate a player's vision. Used Mainly to identify supports. <br>
        damagetakenperminute:  a float used to show a player's damage taken. Top & jungle have higher damage taken.<br>
        damagemitigatedperminute: a float shows a player's damage mitigated per minute.<br>
        earnedgoldshare:  shows how much out of a proportion a player earns gold. Higher for mid & ADCs.<br>
        minionkills:  # of minions a player kills. Used to identify jungles.<br>
        xpat10:  Used to seperate mid & bot lane.<br>
        killshare:  proportion of a player's kill<br>
        deathshare:  proportion of a player's death<br>
        assistshare:  proportion of a player's assist<br> </p>
        <img src="cols.jpg" alt="data">
        <p>Eventually, we take the first 20000 rows in the dataframe as the training data, and the rest as testing data.</p>

        <hr> 
        <h3>Baseline Model</h3>
        <p> We first implement a baseline model using only part of the features. I used KDA only for this model as they are the most common data used when we think about League of Legends performance. </p>
        <p> No function transformer is implemented in this case since we only have quantitive data, and are all on a range from 0 to 1. For the baseline model, we use the very basic linear regression.</p>
        <img src="baselinecode.jpg" alt="Baseline Model data">
        <p> We then use this pipeline to predict the traning and testing data. </p>
        <p> Since we've one-hot coded the positions, in this case I'll use the highest percentage in each column as a '1' (final guess), and the rest of the percentages are all 0. Here are the final outcomes of the data accuracy: </p>
        <p> Note that I've used #correct guess out of all guesses as a measurement of accuracy, because we don't have a true/false scale in this 5-feature prediction. </p>
        <img src="training1.jpg" alt="Baseline Model data">
        <img src="testing1.jpg" alt="Baseline Model data">
        <p>40% is not very better from pure guessing. The model is not performing well, therefore we need to improve the model.  </p>

        <hr> 
        <h3>Final Model</h3>
        <p> To make improvement to the model, the first thing we do is to apply more features - we then implement every feature in the dataframe. </p>
        <p> The reason for my column choices are because bot & mid does more damage, makes more gold, while top & jng takes and mitigates more damage. To identify support, I added visionscore, and I added minionkills to identify top and jng, and xpat10 to identify bot and mid, as bot shares exp with support thus wil have a lower xpat10.</p>
        <p> I then applied sigmoid function to all data that does not range from 0 to 1, so that they would not have too big variations. </p>
        <p> I've also changed the model from basic LR to a decision tree, so that we can have hyperparemeters.</p>
        <p> Because we actually carry out the prediction 5 times, we use a GridSearchCV obj to identify the best parameters for EACH model. Here is one of the 5 set of parameters:</p>
        <img src="jng param.jpg" alt="Parameter for jungle">
        <p> We make a model based on these meters after that (5 models, actuallly). After the model is being made, we use these pipelines to predict both the training set and the testing set.  </p>
        <p> And here are our results from both of them: </p>
        <img src="training2.jpg" alt="Baseline Model data">
        <img src="testing2.jpg" alt="Baseline Model data">
        <p> 94% sounds like an acceptable correctness rate. The model has indeed been better trained. Progress has been made! </p>

        <hr> 
        <h3>Fairness Analysis</h3>
        <p> For the sake of the fairness of the model, I would like to test if it works fairly on all professional games or if only on games inside relatively more competitive leagues. (let's say, LPL, LCK, LEC, LCS only.)  </p>
        <p> Therefore, the hypothesis are:</p>
        <p> H0: The model is fair. It works on LPL, LCK, LEC & LCS equally good or not so good as with the others. </p>
        <p> H1: The model is not fair. It is better at computing more competitive leagues(since we've trained the data on that).</p>
        <p> Two groups are: </p>
        <p> 1. Game entries from the 4 leagues</p>
        <p> 2. All entries that are games not from these 4 leagues.</p>
        <p> We choose the standard alpha = 0.05. Firstly, we calculate the observed statistic by calculating the model's performance on the 2 groups and calculate the difference. </p>
        <p> After that, we shuffle the league column, and test out the model's performance on the 2 groups and calculate the difference, then shuffle the column again. Loop this for 100 times.</p>
        <p> Here's the result that we get</p>
        <img src="histo.jpg" alt="Histogram for resampling data">
        <p> We then calculate the p value, calculating how much percentage of collected data are beyond our observed statistic. </p>
        <p> With the p-value of 0.41, we fail to reject the null hypothesis at a significant level of alpha = 0.05. </p>
        <p> Therefore, we can conclude that there isn't a statistical evidence showing that the model is not fair regarding testing on less competitive or more competitive leagues.</p>
